I'm accepting more specific versions of the DTR proteins, but not alternative isoforms

Accession number degeneracy corresponding to a single name
7 proteins with 2 accession IDs, 1 with three
MLV-related proviral Env polyprotein-like (XP_027289999.1, XP_027288341.1, XP_027284602.1)

My amino acid substitution rules
{
    'B':'D',
    'Z':'E',
    'X':'A',
    'J':'L'
}

Precursor/pro-proteins
transforming growth factor beta-1 proprotein isoform X2
matrix metalloproteinase-14 precursor


Isoform inclusion with non-specific literature names (which increases
the apparent number of common HCPs that I found, e.g.)
glutathione S-transferase Y1 isoform X2 = glutathione s-transferase
glutathione S-transferase Mu 6 = glutathione s-transferase mu 6
lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase isoform X2 = carboxypeptidase
putative phospholipase B-like 2 = phospholipase b-like 2

^ Close calls that were included
group XV phospholipase A2 isoform X2 = lipase
lysophospholipase-like protein 1 isoform X2  = lipase
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 isoform X2 = peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase

^ -type/-like/-related proteins that were included (with the exception of ubiquitin-like species)
vimentin-type intermediate filament-associated coiled-coil protein isoform X2 = vimentin
serpin B6-like = serpin b6
galectin-related protein isoform X2 = galectin
drebrin-like protein isoform X2 = drebrin


Isoform inclusion with non-specific name in my data
transgelin = transgelin-2
histone H2B type 1 = histone h2b type 1-n


Exclusion of binding partners, receptors, recognition factors, activating proteins, inhibitors, conjugating factors, etc.
galectin-3-binding protein != galectin-3
